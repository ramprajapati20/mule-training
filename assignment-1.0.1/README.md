Mulesoft has to expose an API â€“ Need to develop RAML (Take any example which u feel to take)
Once request received from HTTP need to publish to VM
Need to subscribe the data from VM
Once data subscribe it from VM and write the data into FILE
You need to read the same file which u written in step 4
Once you receive the file you need to call one HTTP end point (http://httpbin.org/get)
